# Fronius Datamanager Logger and Monitor

This repository contains a Docker Compose stack designed to capture real-time photovoltaic (PV) production data from a Fronius inverter capable of using SolarAPI v.1. The stack consists of two services:

- **Telegraf**: An agent that listens for push calls from the inverter through an exposed HTTP endpoint.
- **InfluxDB**: A database that stores the PV production data for analysis and monitoring.

The Fronius inverter uses the **SolarAPI v1 - CurrentData - PowerFlow** to push energy flow data to Telegraf. This service sends JSON-formatted data which includes real-time information about power production, consumption, grid import/export, and more.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

You will also need access to your Fronius inverter's web interface for configuring the push service.

## 📂 Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juaniten/fronius-datamanager-monitor.git
cd fronius-datamanager-monitor
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### 📄 .env File

You need to create a `.env` file from the provided `.env.example` template to configure the environment variables.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and configure the following:
   - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME`: Your InfluxDB admin username.
   - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD`: Your InfluxDB admin password.
   - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG`: Name of your organization for InfluxDB.
   - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET`: The bucket where the data will be stored.
   - `TELEGRAF_MEASUREMENT_NAME_OVERRIDE`: Name for overriding the base name of the measurement in the DB.
   - `TELEGRAF_ENDPOINT_PATH_NAME`: Endpoint path that Telegraf will expose. This should match the Fronius push service path (e.g., `fronius`).
   - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN`: A secure, randomly generated token (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate one).

### 📊 InfluxDB Setup

1. Run the stack with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. This will automatically set up the initial InfluxDB user, organization, and bucket with the token defined in the `.env` file.

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8086` in your browser to access the InfluxDB UI. Use the credentials from the `.env` file to log in and start using InfluxDB.

### 🔌 Fronius Inverter Configuration

To allow your Fronius inverter to send push data to your Telegraf endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Fronius inverter's web interface.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Push Service**.
3. Add a new HTTP push service with the following details:

   - **Data format**: Select **"SolarAPI v1 - CurrentData - PowerFlow"**.
   - **Interval**: Set your desired data transmission interval and ensure "activated" is checked.
   - **Server:Port**: `http://<your-server-ip>:8094` (replace `<your-server-ip>` with your server's IP address).
   - **Upload file name**: `/<TELEGRAF_ENDPOINT_PATH_NAME>` (replace `<TELEGRAF_ENDPOINT_PATH_NAME>` with the value set in your `.env` file, e.g., `fronius`).

4. Save and activate the push service.

### 📜 Understanding Fronius Push Service Data

The **SolarAPI v1 - CurrentData - PowerFlow** push service provides JSON data with real-time information about your PV system's power flow. This data includes:

- **P_PV**: Power produced by the PV system.
- **P_Grid**: Power imported from or exported to the grid.
- **P_Load**: Power consumed by your household.
- **P_Akku**: Power from a connected battery (if available).
- **rel_Autonomy**: The percentage of power self-sufficiency.
- **rel_SelfConsumption**: The percentage of solar power consumed directly on-site.

This JSON data is pushed to Telegraf, which parses it and sends it to InfluxDB for storage.

Of course, you can choose any other data format option and adapt the Telegraf service accordingly. You can find the operating instructions for the Push Service on the [Fronius website](https://www.fronius.com).


## 📈 Accessing Data in InfluxDB

Once the stack is running, and the Fronius inverter is pushing data, you can access and visualize the data using the InfluxDB UI. Here’s how:

1. **Login to InfluxDB**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8086` and log in using the credentials specified in the `.env` file.

2. **Using Data Explorer**:

   - From the InfluxDB UI, go to **Data Explorer**.
   - Select your bucket (e.g., `fronius_measurements`).
   - Choose the measurement (e.g., `my_inverter`) and fields you want to explore (such as `P_PV`, `P_Load`).

3. **Create Dashboards**:

   - In the InfluxDB UI, navigate to the **Dashboards** section.
   - Click **Create Dashboard** and add a cell with your desired queries to visualize data such as real-time power production, consumption, or grid export.

4. **Monitor Data in Real-Time**:
   - Dashboards allow you to visualize your inverter’s data in real-time, enabling you to track energy production, consumption, grid interactions and much more.

## ▶️ Running the Stack

To start the services, simply run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start both the InfluxDB and Telegraf services. Telegraf will now listen on the configured HTTP endpoint for push calls from the Fronius inverter.

To stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```


## 🌐 Port Configuration

### Local Access

By default, the services run on the following ports:

- InfluxDB: `8086`
- Telegraf: `8092/UDP`, `8094/TCP`, `8125/UDP`

Ensure these ports are not being blocked by your firewall. If you plan to access the services locally only, no further configuration is required.

### Remote Access (Port Forwarding)

If you want to expose your Telegraf endpoint to the internet (e.g., if your Fronius inverter is on a different network), you will need to open or forward ports:

- **Port forwarding**: Forward port `8094` (Telegraf HTTP endpoint) from your router to the machine running Docker.
- **Firewall rules**: Ensure that the ports (e.g., `8094` for Telegraf) are open for external access.


## 🔒 Security

**Note:** Consider using HTTPS and securing your Telegraf endpoint with basic authentication or TLS for secure data transmission.
